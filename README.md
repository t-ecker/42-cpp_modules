### C++ Modules - 42 School

### 🏆 Score: **100/100** (for each module)

## 📚 About the Project

The **C++ Modules** are a series of projects designed to introduce Object-Oriented Programming using C++. The curriculum consists of 10 modules (CPP 00 to CPP 09), each focusing on specific C++ concepts and gradually increasing in complexity. These modules provide a comprehensive foundation in modern C++ programming, from basic syntax to advanced features like templates, containers, and algorithms.

## 🗂️ Module Breakdown

[**Module 00**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp00.git): Introduction to C++ syntax, classes, objects and basic memory management  
[**Module 01**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp01.git): Dynamic memory allocation, references, pointers, switch statements, and file streams  
[**Module 02**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp02.git): Canonical form, operator overloading and fixed-point arithmetic  
[**Module 03**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp03.git): Single and multiple inheritance, access specifiers, and class hierarchy  
[**Module 04**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp04.git): Abstract classes, virtual functions, and runtime polymorphism  
[**Module 05**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp05.git): Exception handling with try/catch blocks and custom exceptions  
[**Module 06**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp06.git): Type casting in C++: static, dynamic, const, and reinterpret casts  
[**Module 07**](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp07.git): Function and class templates  
**[Module 08](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp08.git)–[09](https://github.com/t-ecker/cpp09.git)**: Standard Template Library usage with containers, iterators, and algorithms
